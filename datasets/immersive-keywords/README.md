# Immersive Keywords Dataset

The *Immersive Keywords* dataset tracks how terms related to immersive media appear in global online news.  
It provides a longitudinal view of how cultural, technological and experiential concepts rise or decline in public discourse.

The dataset is curated by **Martin Sambauer** (https://martin-sambauer.com)  
and published by **Softmachine** (https://softmachine.de) as part of the immersive-data-hub.

## Purpose

This dataset provides a quantitative foundation for understanding how immersive media enters cultural consciousness.  
It enables researchers, creatives and strategists to track the diffusion of immersive terminology across time and compare immersive concepts against each other or baseline controls.

Use cases include:

- longitudinal trend analysis  
- cultural diffusion and adoption research  
- comparison of emerging vs. mature immersive concepts  
- input for whitepapers, market reports and strategic documents  
- qualitative–quantitative hybrid research  
- evidence base for essays and impact-investment narratives (see linked articles)

## Key Results (with example graphics)

### 1. Immersive storytelling and immersive experience rise sharply  
**Graphic:**  
http://martin-sambauer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/immersive-storytelling-graph.jpg  

This graph shows the multi-year rise of “immersive storytelling”, making it one of the strongest and most stable growth terms in the dataset.  
It demonstrates a structural narrative shift: immersive media is no longer seen primarily as technology, but as a mode of communication and creative expression.

---

### 2. Traditional media declines: “television” as benchmark  
**Graphic:**

“Television” serves as a reference keyword.  
Its steady decline confirms both:  
- long-term erosion of TV’s cultural centrality  
- dataset consistency (expected baseline behaviour)

---

### 3. The dataset identifies the dog *Uggie* (The Artist) – validation of named entities  
**Graphic:**

The dataset successfully isolates “Uggie” as a distinct entity, demonstrating that:  
- named entities are identifiable  
- cultural signals can be traced precisely even when niche

This acts as a validation of correctness and sensitivity within the corpus.

---

### 4. AR shows slow but steady growth with volatility  
**Graphic:**

AR grows, but exhibits fluctuations linked to product cycles and hype waves.  
It suggests a transition phase: AR is culturally relevant, but still tied to the tech-industry narrative.

---

### 5. VR shows stronger peaks but weaker structural progression  
**Graphic:**

VR produces clear spikes around hardware moments or major releases — but its long-term trajectory is flatter.  
The dataset indicates that VR is no longer the sole driver of immersive discourse.

---

### 6. “Immersive learning” emerges as a strong mid-tier growth field  
**Graphic:**  
http://martin-sambauer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/immersive-learning-immersive-keywords-dataset.jpg  

“Immersive learning” is steadily rising and shows signs of becoming a culturally anchored term in education, museums, corporate training and learning environments.

---

### 7. “Immersive experience” remains one of the strongest long-term trends  
**Graphic:**  
http://martin-sambauer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/immersive-exeprience-immersive-keywords-dataset.jpg  

This graph confirms that broad experiential framing outpaces technical terminology.  
Immersive media is increasingly framed as an experience, not a device.

---

### 8. Artificial Intelligence intersects with immersive media  
**Graphic:**  
http://martin-sambauer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/artificiial-intelligence-immersive-keywords-dataset.jpg  

AI shows an exponential rise that overlaps strongly with immersive keywords.  
This suggests that immersive media is entering a convergence phase with AI-driven creativity and narrative automation.

---

### Overall interpretation
- Immersive media discourse is rising globally.  
- Narrative and experiential terms grow faster than technical ones.  
- Control benchmarks (“television”, “Uggie”) validate dataset quality.  
- AR/VR fluctuate and increasingly play supporting roles in broader cultural framing.  
- The dataset reveals a long-term structural shift toward **experience-centric thinking** in media, culture and communication.
