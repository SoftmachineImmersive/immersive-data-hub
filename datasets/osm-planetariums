# OSM Planetariums Dataset

This dataset provides a global list of planetariums extracted and curated from OpenStreetMap (OSM). It is part of the SIP (Sustainable Immersive Practices) initiative by [Softmachine Immersive](https://softmachine.de), supporting data-informed analysis of immersive infrastructure worldwide.

## 🧪 Methodology

### Methodological Note: Planetarium Data Extraction and Processing

**1. Data Source**  
The initial dataset was extracted from OpenStreetMap (OSM) using the Overpass API. All nodes, ways, and relations tagged with `amenity=planetarium` were included, resulting in 888 entries worldwide. Each record included coordinates and, where available, address components such as city, state, or country.

**2. Country Assignment**  
Since many OSM entries lacked explicit country tags, we geocoded each coordinate against Natural Earth boundary polygons. Initially, 1:110m resolution boundaries were used, but these excluded island and coastal entries. We then switched to 1:50m data, enabling complete assignment of all 888 locations to specific countries.

**3. Data Cleaning**
- Empty names were replaced with the placeholder `"No-Name"`.
- Planetariums were numbered per country (e.g., “Germany 1”, “Germany 2”) for easy referencing.
- A Google Maps link was generated for each entry based on lat/lon for quick validation.
- Erroneous or duplicate entries (e.g., in Argentina, Chile, Germany) were removed.

**4. Filtering**  
The original dataset contained both planetariums and observatories. Using keyword-based exclusion (e.g., "Observatory", "Sternwarte", "天文台", "Обсерватория"), observatories were removed, leaving ~830 valid planetarium entries.

**5. Translation and Normalization**  
Many names appeared in non-Latin scripts (e.g., Chinese, Arabic, Cyrillic). All were translated into English with the original preserved in parentheses for global readability and cultural accuracy.  
Examples:
- 上海天文馆 → 上海天文馆 (Shanghai Planetarium)  
- مركز القبة السماوية → مركز القبة السماوية (Planetarium Center)

**6. Completeness and Limitations**
- Final dataset: **~830 unique planetariums worldwide**
- Industry estimates suggest ~4,000 fulldome venues exist globally. Thus, OSM may represent ~20–25% of the actual total.
- Still, this curated dataset is **open, transparent, reproducible**, and provides a solid baseline for comparative analysis and integration with proprietary sources.
