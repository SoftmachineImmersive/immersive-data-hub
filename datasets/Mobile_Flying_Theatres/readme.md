## Purpose

This dataset provides a global baseline for understanding:

- which companies produce mobile immersive theatres,  
- where mobile domes or mobile flying theatres have been deployed,  
- how mobile immersive infrastructures contribute to regional reach, accessibility and temporary cultural programming.

It serves as a foundation for research on touring immersive entertainment, event-based deployment strategies and mobile experiential environments.

## Key Result (condensed)

From the interpretation at  
https://martin-sambauer.com/immersive-datasets/:

> *Mobile immersive infrastructures act as flexible, rapid-deployment venues that extend immersive media into regions where permanent installations do not exist. They function as mobility-multipliers, bringing immersive formats to audiences that would otherwise remain unserved.*

This insight positions mobile flying theatres and mobile LED domes as important bridging technologies within the global immersive ecosystem.
